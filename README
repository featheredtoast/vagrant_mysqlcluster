very crude implementation for mysql clusters on a vagrant system
Works for lucid32 vagrantbox.

vagrant up should bring all servers online: 1 management server, 2 data nodes, 2 APIs.

virtual machine IP addresses:
Management: 44.44.44.4

data node 1: 44.44.44.2
data node 2: 44.44.44.3

API node 1: 44.44.44.5
API node 2: 44.44.44.6

Note:
-Data nodes may get kicked off the server if the load from the 5 VMs are too much (missed heartbeat).

  To check connected nodes, log into the management server
  cd /usr/local/mysql-cluster
  bin/ndb_mgm --ndb-connectstring=44.44.44.4:2205
  show

  To reconnect a data node:
  sudo /usr/local/mysql-cluster/bin/ndbd --ndb-connectstring=44.44.44.4:2205

-MYSQL API nodes currently may not be accessed from outside local vm. To enable SSH from anywhere:
log into mysql from API nodes and update root privileges:
/usr/local/mysql-cluster/bin/mysql -u root
update mysql.user set host='%' where user='root' and host='localhost';flush privileges;

-This build contains mysql-cluster v 7.2.5. Included in repo so as to avoid slow wget 5 times each up.
